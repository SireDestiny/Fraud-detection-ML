# Fraud detection model trained and deployed in Microsoft Azure environment
A machine-learning fraud detection model was built to detect fraudulent financial transactions. It was trained and tested with more than a million transactions. The data was massively imbalanced and was treated with SMOTE resampling to overcome the challenge. The model was deployed in Azure as a web application service for real-time inferencing.
