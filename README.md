# Fraud-detection-ml trained and deployed in Microsoft Azure environment
A machine learning fraud detection model was built to detect fraudulent financial transactions. It was trained and tested with more than a million transactions, using a Random Forest classifier.  The data was massively imbalanced and was treated with SMOTE resampling to overcome the data imbalance. The model was deployed as an online endpoint for real-time inferencing in Azure.
